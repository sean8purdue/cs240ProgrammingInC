## Questions
1\. Scope of nested variable implemented with stack frame

2\. How to read a unknown length filename to program, read unkown length argument to shell (lab3) 
 
- Know to use fixed-sized array, but the pitfall is, have to predefine the limit of filename length. Is there other methods to do this.

3\. Some library like <Math.h>, use `sqrt()` need link with `-lm` option, since `Math.h` doesn't have the code of `sqrt()`. Why `printf()` don't need. Is it dynamic linking?

4\. Function pointer

5\. Two dimensional array, `Struct Node ** PNode` in linked list.
