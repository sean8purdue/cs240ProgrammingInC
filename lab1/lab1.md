# Lab 1: Getting acquainted with C and its system environment 

Due: 06/20/2017 (Tue.), 11:59 PM

## Objective

The objective of this introductory lab is to familiarize you with the system environment of C programs under Linux.

## Reading

Read chapter 1 from Kernighan&Ritchie (textbook). The introduction provides an overview of C programming. It is a bit dense. You are not expected to understand all the material. What you need to understand is the material discussed in class, with the textbook serving as a supplementary resource.

## Lab1 code base

The C code base for lab1 is available as a tarball at 

/u/data/u3/park/pub/cs240/lab1.tar 

on the Linux machines in LWSN B148. Copy it to your working directory and untar it using 

% tar xvf lab1.tar 

Under lab1, you will find 7 subdirectories that contain versions of the example code discussed in class. As noted in class, always compile and run the final version on the pod machines in LWSN 148.

## Problems [145 pts]

### Problem1 (20 pts)

Compile the code in directory v1 by running 

% gcc main.c 

What is the nature of the output a.out generated by gcc? What are the three steps performed by gcc that results in a.out? What does each of the steps accomplish? 

How does gcc react if you omit the type declaration of main()? Will gcc generate an executable? What happens if you declare main()'s type as void?
